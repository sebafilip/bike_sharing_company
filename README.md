# bike_sharing_company
This project focuses on the analysis of bike sharing company data. Using python and mainly the pandas library, the data is processed and analyzed. The output is prepared information represented in graphical and tabular form for business and managerial decision making.

This is a bicycle sharing company in Edinburgh that is interested in several points related to bicycle usage. They need to know:
 - Identification of active and inactive stations
 - Identify stations where bikes are piling up and where they are potentially missing
 - The impact of weather on demand for bikes
 - Weekend and weekday bike rental
 - And more
